## Abstract

The WG Display is a display that shows information relevant to the people living in a shared flat.
The information is displayed on a display that is mounted on the wall.  

## Introduction

### Motivation

Over the years living with together with different people, the need arose to have a central place for displaying certain information that is relevant to all of us. This information could be anything from the current weather, the next bus departures from the nearest public transport station to the temperature of the Aare river. The idea is to have a central place where all this information is displayed. This place is the WG Display.

Since we had quite a bit of experience with the Raspberry Pi, we decided to use it as the main controller.  
Together with a 5" display case that we had lying around, we were able to quickly build a prototype.
The software was implemented in Python, which allowed us to quickly develop the first version of the software.  

Over time, the software was extended to support more features.  
Guests coming over to our place started to take notice and wanted to have a WG Display of their own.  

The problem was, that our solution was "too hacked together".  
There was no way to configure it to the user's needs.  
We also had occasional problems with the software crashing, which was not very user friendly.  

That's how I got the idea of a complete rewrite of the software.  
The need for such a display was clearly validated over the years and we had enough time to determine the shortcomings of the previous solution.  
The new software should be more robust, easier to configure and better documented.

### Deliverables

The deliverables for this project are:

- The codebase of a working prototype of the application
- Documentation of the codebase
- A GitHub repository that forms the basis for growing a community around the project
- A project report that describes the project and the software architecture
- A presentation that explains the project and the software architecture

## Method

### Project management

Since the project was developed in a way that allowed for contributions from multiple people, GitHub was used not only as a code repository, but also as a project management tool.  

The GitHub project board was used as a task management tool.

![GitHub project board](./images/github_project.png)

This has the advantage, that the project board is tightly integrated with the code repository.  
Tasks can be connected to pull requests and issues.  

Tasks were assigned to a milestone, that represented the the end of the Project 2 course.  

![milestone](./images/milestone.png)
Since tasks were subdivided into smaller tasks, the milestone view gave a nice overview of the progress of the project.

### Repository settings

The GitHub project was configured to enforce several rules:

- No user should be allowed to push directly to a non feature branch.
  This was achieved by setting a branch protection rule that required a pull request before merging.
- All pull requests required all status checks to pass before they could be merged.
  This was achieved by setting a branch protection rule that required all status checks to pass before merging.
- Prevent force pushes on non feature branches.
- Prevent merge commits from being pushed to non feature branches.
  This ensures a linear commit history.

With this being setup, the project should be ready for contributions from multiple people.

## System architecture

### Programming language

The programming language of choice for this project was Rust.

Rust is a systems programming language that is designed to be fast, reliable and secure.  
It's extensive type system ensures that the code is safe and robust.  
The language is also very well suited for writing concurrent code, which is a requirement for this project.
Since Rust can be compiled to web assembly, it could also be used to write the configuration frontend.
Furthermore, the developer experience is very good. This is reflected in the [Stack Overflow developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/), where Rust is ranked as the most loved programming language for the past seven years.
Last but not least, Rust has a very active community and a big ecosystem of `crates` (libraries) that simplified the development of the project greatly.

Given all this, Rust presented itself as the perfect choice for this project.

### Overview

Configuration backend

- Serve frontend (html, css, webasm)
- Provide REST API for frontend to read and write configuration parameters

Configuration frontend

- Provide UI and logic for user to configure widgets and other system aspects
- Interact with REST API provided by the backend

Renderer

- Render information to a terminal UI

### Main Rust crates used in the project

- [cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) for rendering the display output
- [yew](https://crates.io/crates/yew) for the configuration frontend
- [rocket](https://crates.io/crates/rocket) for the configuration backend (server and REST API)
- [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) for simplified cross-compilation
- [tokio](https://tokio.rs) asynchronous runtime
- [sled](http://sled.rs) embedded database for storing the configuration

### Other dependencies

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling the configuration frontend

### Configuration frontend

The configuration frontend is a web application that allows the user to configure the WG Display.  
The frontend was written using the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) framework.  
Yew is a component-based framework for writing web applications in Rust.  

### Cross compilation

Since this project is expected to run on all Raspberry Pi models, cross compilation was used to build the project for all supported targets.  

The following targets are supported:

- arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf (Raspberry PI Zero 1 / Zero W / Zero WH)
- armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf (Raspberry PI 2 / 3 / 4 / Zero 2 W)
- native (whatever the build machine is)

To achieve this, the [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) project was used.  
This project allows to build Rust projects for different targets using prebuilt Docker images.  
Not having to manually install the required toolchains for each target is a huge advantage.  

### Build process

TODO

### Tests

TODO

### Continuous integration

Continuous integration was implemented using GitHub Actions.  
There were the following requirements:

- The tests should be run on every push to a feature branch.
- The project should be built for all supported targets on every push to a feature branch.
- A new release should be created for every new version tag on the main branch.

To achieve this, three seperate workflows were created.

The following workflow definition is used to build and publish a new release on every version tag on the main branch:

```yaml
name: Build release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10
      - 'v*'

        mv app/target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/wg_display app/target/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/wg-display-arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
    - uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
