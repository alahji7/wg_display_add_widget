## Abstract

The WG Display is a display that shows information relevant to the people living in a shared flat.
The information is displayed on a display that is mounted on the wall.  

## Introduction

### Motivation

Over the years living with together with different people, the need arose to have a central place for displaying certain information that is relevant to all of us. This information could be anything from the current weather, the next bus departures from the nearest public transport station to the temperature of the Aare river. The idea is to have a central place where all this information is displayed. This place is the WG Display.

Since we had quite a bit of experience with the Raspberry Pi, we decided to use it as the main controller.  
Together with a 5" display case that we had lying around, we were able to quickly build a prototype.
The software was implemented in Python, which allowed us to quickly develop the first version of the software.  

Over time, the software was extended to support more features.  
Guests coming over to our place started to take notice and wanted to have a WG Display of their own.  

The problem was, that our solution was "too hacked together".  
There was no way to configure it to the user's needs.  
We also had occasional problems with the software crashing, which was not very user friendly.  

That's how I got the idea of a complete rewrite of the software.  
The need for such a display was clearly validated over the years and we had enough time to determine the shortcomings of the previous solution.  
The new software should be more robust, easier to configure and better documented.

### Deliverables

The deliverables for this project are:

- The codebase of a working prototype of the application
- Documentation of the codebase
- A GitHub repository that forms the basis for growing a community around the project
- A project report that describes the project and the software architecture
- A presentation that explains the project and the software architecture
